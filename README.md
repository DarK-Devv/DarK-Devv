### Hi There 👋
I'm Veeti (DarK-Devs), I am goal oriented and quickly learning ICT engineering student, who is not afraid of setbacks and challenges. I would like to create new modern solutions.

I'm 21-year-old second-year ICT-engineering student majoring in Software Engineering. I am studying at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.

I have gained work experience alongside my studies, mainly through summer jobs. My work experience in them has focused mainly on web development and video editing. In my spare time, I work as a young entrepreneur and make marketing videos and websites tailored to the client’s order.

I am a strong teamplayer, but I am also able to work independently. I have worked as a Scrum Master. That is a natural way of working for me. I am a quick and eager to learn new things. I have a good command of the programs used at work. By nature I am calm and cooperative. As an employee, I am solution-oriented and reliable.
