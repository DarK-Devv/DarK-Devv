### Hi there 👋
I'm Veeti (DarK-Devs), I am goal oriented and quickly learning new things in the ICT engineering student, who is not afraid of setbacks and challenges. I would definitely like to be involved in implementing new modern solutions.

I'm 20-year-old second-year ICT-engineering student majoring in Software Engineering. I am studying at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.

I have gained some work experience alongside my studies, mainly through summer jobs. My work experience in them has focused mainly on web development and video editing. In my spare time, I work as a young entrepreneur and make marketing videos and websites tailored to the client’s order.

I am a strong team player, but I am also able to work independently. I have worked as a Scrum Master. That is a natural way of working for me. I am a quick and eager to learn. I embrace new things quickly. I have a good command of the programs used at work. By nature not calm and cooperative. As an employee, I am solution-oriented and reliable.
