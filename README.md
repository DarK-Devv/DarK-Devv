### Hi There 👋
I am Veeti, also known as DarK-Devs, a driven and swiftly adapting student of ICT engineering, who embraces challenges and setbacks with a positive attitude. My ambition is to develop innovative and contemporary solutions.

At 22 years old, I am in my second year of ICT engineering studies, with a focus on Software Engineering, at Metropolia University of Applied Sciences.

My work experience has been enriched through various jobs alongside my studies, primarily concentrating on web development and video editing. Outside of my academic commitments, I engage in entrepreneurship, creating custom marketing videos and websites as per client requirements.

My strengths include being an effective team player as well as possessing the capability to work autonomously. My experience as a Scrum Master has honed my natural inclination towards collaborative work. I am quick to learn and enthusiastic about acquiring new skills. I am proficient in the software tools required for my professional endeavors. My demeanor is calm and cooperative, and as an employee, I am committed to finding solutions and maintaining reliability.
