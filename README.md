### Hey there! 👋

I'm Veeti Pere (aka DarK-Devs), an ICT Engineer with a passion for building modern, impactful digital solutions. I thrive on challenges and love finding smart ways to create value for people and businesses. My journey started with a degree in ICT Engineering, specializing in Software Engineering, and has evolved into full-on entrepreneurship.

## 💼 Professional Experience

For three years, I worked as a Service Desk Specialist at Euroclear, mastering problem-solving, customer support, and technical troubleshooting in a high-pressure environment. Alongside my day job, I dove deep into web development, video editing, and project coordination through freelance gigs and my own ventures.

## 🚀 Fhatal Studios: Digital by Design

I'm now focused on Fhatal Studios, my IT and web development studio. At Fhatal Studios, we help startups and small businesses launch, grow, and stand out online. We use a prototype-first approach, combining AI-powered tools with a human touch to deliver custom websites, digital workflows, and creative content. Our goal is to make quality digital services accessible without the agency price tag.

## 💡 Entrepreneurial Spirit

Running my own studio has sharpened my skills in client management, digital marketing, and product design. I’ve learned how to translate business needs into digital solutions, and I’m always looking for new ways to improve the process with automation and smart tech.

I also dabble in crypto and trading, always learning more about how digital economies work.

## 🤝 Collaboration & Leadership

Whether leading as a Scrum Master or working independently, I bring a calm, cooperative, and solution-oriented mindset to every project. I believe in transparency, open feedback, and building trust through clear communication and reliable delivery.

## 🔍 What Drives Me?

Continuous learning, challenging projects, and connecting technology with real-world impact. I’m here to push boundaries, solve problems, and make digital life easier for everyone.
